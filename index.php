			<h2>Wilbur Curtis Integration to SEB Professional</h2>
			<p>Starting October 1, 2023, SEB Professional will streamline the ordering process for WMF, Schaerer, and Curtis brands. This means you can now place orders for all three brands through a single system using one purchase order.</p>
			<p>In the coming weeks, we will send more details regarding this transition. After October 1, 2023, ordering from us will be much simpler, especially when combining any of our three brands into a single order.</p>
			<p>To ensure a successful transition, please establish an account with SEB Professional North America. From September 30, 2023, onwards, you will be required to place any Wilbur Curtis order with SEB Professional. Therefore, SEB Professional will be required to be listed as a supplier for your organization. If you already have an account with SEB Professional there is no need to create an additional account. Going forward, you will merely purchase all of our brands through that single account.</p>
			<p>This page will serve as a centralized hub for accessing information about the transition. So, please check back regularly. </p>
			<p>Please expect further communications in the following weeks and months to verify your account setup, provide additional information, explain how your account will be affected, and keep you updated on any changes or revisions.</p>
			<p>If you have questions, please reach out to our Customer Service Team at <a href="mailto:csrassistance@wilburcurtis.com" target="_blank">csrassistance@wilburcurtis.com</a></p>

			<h3>Status Update</h3>
			<p><strong>September 25, 2023</strong> A communication was sent to all Curtis customers in late September stating as a reminder, starting October 2023, SEB Professional will streamline the ordering process for WMF, Schaerer, and Wilbur Curtis brands. This means you can now place orders for all three brands through a single system using one purchase order.</p>
			<p>In order to continue a seamless business relationship with our existing customers, the important information below was included in this communication, and how this applies to your business:</p>
			<p><strong>For Existing SEB Professional Customers</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>SEB Professional has moved to a new office. Please update your records to reflect our new address: 2600 Michelson Drive, Irvine, CA 92612</li>
				<li>If you currently pay via check, please ensure all checks go to our Lockbox.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>For Wilbur Curtis Customers moving to SEB Professional</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>We provided our W-9 and Banking Information/Lockbox for payments in the sent communication to ensure you can create SEB Professional as a new supplier in your systems</li>
				<li>If you hold a tax-exempt status, we kindly requested the submission of an updated resale certificate designating SEB Professional North America as the seller. To facilitate this, we included a Multijurisdictional Tax Form in the email for customers who maintain resale certificates across multiple states. We asked for this to be sent to the AR-US@seb-professional.com inbox no later than October 15th to ensure accurate tax calculation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Be aware that all orders placed beginning October 2, 2023 must be sent to SEB Professional North America.</p>
			<p>If you have questions, or missed the email with attachments needed, please reach out to our Customer Service Team at <a href="mailto:csrassistance@wilburcurtis.com" target="_blank">csrassistance@wilburcurtis.com</a>. We look forward to a long and successful partnership with all of our valued customers!</p>
